I"ƒ<p>One of the things I am learning this semester in AI for Robotics is Kalman
Filter.  To understand the mathematics better, I coded both in Python and Ruby.</p>

<p>Some Python and Ruby comparison here:</p>

<p>I could see why after coding in both Python and Ruby, the academic institutions prefer the
Python syntax.  It just reads better when you do math.  I am glad Ruby has
keyword arguments now too, similar to Python. I didnâ€™t really refactor the Ruby
code, but Python still seemed easier for doing mathematical problems.</p>
