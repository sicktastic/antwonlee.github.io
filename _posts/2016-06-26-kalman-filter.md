One of the things I am learning this semester in AI for Robotics is Kalman
Filter.  To understand the mathematics better, I coded both in Python and Ruby.

Some Python and Ruby comparison here:

I could see why after coding in both Python and Ruby, the academic institutions prefer the
Python syntax.  It just reads better when you do math.  I am glad Ruby has
keyword arguments now too, similar to Python. I didn't really refactor the Ruby
code, but Python still seemed easier for doing mathematical problems.
