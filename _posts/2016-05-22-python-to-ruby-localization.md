I am taking Artificial Intelligence for Robotics this semester.  This week we went over probability, bayes rule, localization, and some liner algebra.

<!--more-->

One of the problem set was to code localization in python. As a fun excerise, I decided to code this in Ruby as well.  So I am going to give myself a week to code this again in Ruby...  I will be back to this post.  =)
